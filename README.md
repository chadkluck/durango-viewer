# durango-viewer
Durango Viewer is a quick and dirty template to get you started in image loading and light boxes (click on an image to see a full screen overlay)

NOTE: This is a beta project so the tags used by it may and will change. However, if not used as a plugin the code can be dissected and pieces put into your own code. The code is not yet complete, clean, nor optimized for production. It is here to learn from. Though great care has been used in testing, I am not responsible for errors in the code at this time.</p>

Durango Viewer turns pre-defined links to large images into previews and when followed displays the image in a lightbox. Eventually the hope is that it will create slideshows from WordPress galleries and auto responsive video and images.

## Key Features:
* Responsive
* Accessible
* Gracefully degrade if NOSCRIPT
* Lightweight
* Loads images behind the scenes
